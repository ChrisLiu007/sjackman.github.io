I work\r\nwith the genome sequencing data of a variety of species, including human and\r\nthe white spruce tree. I develop software that takes fragmented genome\r\nsequencing data and attempts to reassemble the original genome from which the\r\nshort fragments were derived. My undergraduate degree is in computer\r\nengineering. I'm a programmer, an avid traveller, a singer, and an experimental\r\namateur chef.\r\n\r\nProjects\r\n========\r\n\r\nABySS\r\n-----\r\n\r\n![ABySS](http://www.bcgsc.ca/platform/bioinfo/software/abyss/logo)\r\n\r\n[ABySS][] is a genome sequence assembler that distributes the computation of\r\nlarge genome sequence assembly over a cluster of computers using MPI.\r\n\r\n[ABySS]: https://github.com/bcgsc/abyss\r\n\r\nWhite spruce genome sequence assembly\r\n-------------------------------------\r\n\r\n![SMarTForests](http://www.smartforests.ca/Portals/0/LOGO_Smartforest.png)\r\n\r\nThe [SMarTForests][] project used [ABySS][] to assemble the genome of the white\r\nspruce tree, which is twenty gigabases&mdash;seven times larger than the human\r\ngenome. I'm currently working on assembling and annotating the organellar\r\ngenomes of white spruce, the mitochondrion and chloroplast.\r\n\r\n[SMarTForests]: http://www.smartforests.ca/\r\n","google":"UA-2437900-4","note":"Don't delete this file!
