![Shaun Jackman](/img/shaun-jackman.jpg)

I develop software that takes fragmented genome sequencing data and reassembles the original genome from which the short fragments were derived. I analyze genome sequencing data from a variety of species, including spruce trees and human. I have a PhD in bioinformatics, and my undergraduate degree is in computer engineering. I'm a programmer, an avid traveller, a singer, and an enthusiastic cook. I live in Vancouver, Canada.
