[Linuxbrew](http://linuxbrew.sh) is a package manager for Linux derived from [Homebrew](http://brew.sh), the Mac OS package manager. It can be installed in your home directory and does not require root access. The same package manager can be used on both your Linux server and your Mac laptop. Installing a modern version of *glibc* and *gcc* in your home directory on an old distribution of Linux takes five minutes. [Over two hundred](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-science/search?q=bioinformatics) current bioinformatics software packages are available in [Homebrew-science](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-science).
