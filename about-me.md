![Shaun Jackman](/img/shaun-jackman.jpg)

I live in Vancouver, Canada, where I'm a PhD candidate studying bioinformatics at the University of British Columbia with my supervisor, Inanc Birol. I work
with the genome sequencing data of a variety of species, including human and
the white spruce tree. I develop software that takes fragmented genome
sequencing data and attempts to reassemble the original genome from which the
short fragments were derived. My undergraduate degree is in computer
engineering. I'm a programmer, an avid traveller, a singer, and an experimental
amateur chef.
