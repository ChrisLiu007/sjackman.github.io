I worked at the BC Cancer Agency Genome Sciences Centre, where I used genome sequencing to identify mutations in the tumours of cancer patients. I developed the genome sequence assembly software package, ABySS, which was the first system to assemble a human genome using short-read sequencing. I am a masters student studying bioinformatics at the University of British Columbia. I am a first class honours graduate in computer engineering, a computer and electronics enthusiast, an open-source software advocate, an avid traveller, a climber, a singer and an experimental amateur chef. I have ten years of industry experience developing software in C++, C and assembly, including four years developing high-performance distributed and parallel algorithms for genome sequence assembly, and six years developing embedded and real-time systems on compact hardware. I have extensive experience developing portable software for POSIX systems such as GNU/Linux. When developing performance-critical software, I understand the hardware from the transistor up.

Decoding the genes of the cellular components involved in photosynthesis and energy conversion of softwood timber
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

My research looks at decoding the genes of the cellular components involved in photosynthesis and energy conversion of the trees grown for softwood lumber, called conifers. Conifers such as spruce, pine and fir are the primary product of the Canadian lumber industry. As lumber they are mainly used for building homes and are an important part of the Canadian economy. A cell has inside it small components named organelles that each perform a particular job. The organelle called chloroplast absorb light and produce sugar, and this process is called photosynthesis. The organelle called mitochondria are responsible for converting sugar to a form of energy called ATP that is usable by the other organelles of the cell. Most genes of an organism are found in the nucleus of its cell, but the chloroplast and mitochondria have their own genes that are separate from the nucleus. My research will determine which genes are found in the nucleus of the cell and which are found in the chloroplast and mitochondria. This knowledge is helpful in breeding stronger trees that may be more adaptable to climate change or more resistant to insects, such as the mountain pine beetle that recently devastated large forests of British Columbia. Breeding trees that are more adaptable and pest resistant is critical to ensuring the health of our forests and maintaining a prosperous forestry industry.
