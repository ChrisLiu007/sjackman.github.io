I live in Vancouver, Canada, where I'm a PhD student studying bioinformatics at
the University of British Columbia with my supervisor, Inanc Birol. I work
with the genome sequencing data of a variety of species, including human and
the white spruce tree. I develop software that takes fragmented genome
sequencing data and attempts to reassemble the original genome from which the
short fragments were derived. My undergraduate degree is in computer
engineering. I'm a programmer, an avid traveller, a singer, and an experimental
amateur chef.

Projects
========

ABySS
-----

![ABySS](abyss.png)

[ABySS][] is a genome sequence assembler that distributes the computation of
large genome sequence assembly over a cluster of computers using MPI.

White spruce genome sequence assembly
-------------------------------------

![SMarTForests](smartforests.png)

The [SMarTForests][] project used [ABySS][] to assemble the genome of the white
spruce tree, which is twenty gigabases&mdash;seven times larger than the human
genome. I'm currently working on assembling and annotating the organellar
genomes of white spruce, the mitochondrion and chloroplast.
